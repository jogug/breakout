# Breakout
Breakout is a simple [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) clone programmed in Java. 

The game is drawn using a double bufferd JPanel in a JFrame.
In package src2 I started refactoring the code to extract collisions
as objects. 

Feel free to try it out by cloning https://github.com/jogug/breakout.git
and exectuing the breakout.jar file
